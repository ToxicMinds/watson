# The site is Watson's own (Render account watson.assists@gmail.com, since 24 Oct 2026), created
# once through the API (POST /v1/services) as a static site named watson-assists:
#   repo https://github.com/watson-assists/watson, branch main, auto-deploy off,
#   build "npx --yes pnpm@12.15.0 install --frozen-lockfile && npx --yes pnpm@12.15.0 --filter web build"
#   (pnpm 12.15.0, as package.json's packageManager since Prasanth's upgrade of 24 Oct),
#   publish apps/web/out, env NODE_VERSION=24.11.1, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (the project's publishable key);
#   headers for /*: Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'; X-Frame-Options: DENY;
#   X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff; Referrer-Policy: no-referrer;
#   short links: a rewrite /j/* -> /j/index.html, so /j/K7P4QX9M serves the page that opens the
#   patient's link (apps/web/public/serve.json does the same locally).
# Its address is https://watson-assists.onrender.com. Until 24 Oct it was watson-app.onrender.com
# under the owner's own Render account; Render keeps that name, so old links there no longer open.
