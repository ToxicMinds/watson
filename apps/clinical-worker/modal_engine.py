"""Watson's engine on Modal (owner's decision of 16 Oct 2026, decision 0009).

The same engine as on the laptop, with the laptop's exact libraries (uv.lock), on Modal's
processors, and only while work waits. After Synculariti's modal/modal_llm.py and its cost safety.

- `wake`: the address the database knocks on, with a shared secret, when a transcript, a document
  or a form is queued (migration 20261016150000). It starts `drain`.
- `drain`: `clinical-worker drain`: works until nothing has come for a while, then stops. The
  database refuses the stop while work waits, so nothing is left behind.
- `fetch_models`: fills the models volume once, from Hugging Face. The engine reads models from
  disk only.

Cost safety, as Synculariti's: the database's monthly allowance of running time, Modal's workspace
budget, and Modal's credit. One container at a time, an hour at most.

Set up and deploy with scripts/configure-cloud-engine.sh (Modal profile `watson`, never
Synculariti's).
